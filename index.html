    <p>I'm currently 18 and a recent graduate of High School of Computers and Technology. Just like all of you in this cohort, I am pretty interested in technology, 
        I have only studied the hardware in computers when in school (ex; CPU, RAM, HDD, GPU, PSU) but I always wanted to dig deeper into how the computer communicates with its parts.
        Hence, I enrolled into this course in hopes to learn more about computers and hopefully make a career out of this. 
    </p>

    <p>I hope we can all succeed throughout this course! </p>
